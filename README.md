CSharp implementation of the major Software Design Patterns 
Using DotNet 8

Types of patterns:

Creational

    Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    - Factory

Structural

    Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
    
    - Decorator

Behavioral

    Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

    - Strategy
    - Observer

The devcontainer comes with a Taskfile and a dotnet8 runtime, so assuming you are running in the devcontainer

Build the code
```sh
$ task build
```

Run the code
```sh
$ task run
```

Clean
```sh
$ task clean
```
